## Swedish Chess Rules

Swedish Chess (also known as Bughouse or Tandem Chess) is played by four players in teams of two, with two chessboards. Key rules:

- Each team shares a single clock
- When a player makes a move, they hit their team's clock
- When a player captures a piece, they can pass it to their partner
- The partner can place the captured piece on their board as a move
- The game is won by checkmating either opponent's king

## Requirements

- iOS 15.0 or later
- iPhone or iPad

## Development

This app is built using SwiftUI and follows modern iOS development practices. The source code is available for review and modification.
